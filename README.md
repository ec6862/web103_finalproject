Applicants need more skills than ever, and with more and more students applying each year, it has become a bloodfest getting a job. Here comes Job Hunt! The purpose of this website is to find jobs that are posted for a specific position, and label a bunch of skills that the recruiters are searching for that matches YOUR skillset.
