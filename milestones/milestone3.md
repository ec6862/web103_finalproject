## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Understanding the Github project management, as I've never accessed this portion of Github before, so knowing that I have this at hand will make projects a lot more conveninent and smooth.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Just meeting up and communicating about the project.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

I didn't finish all the tasks in the sprint plan, but I will attempt to this weekend by hosting a 1 hour session with my groupmate.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

TBA, as we have yet to discuss this.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Not sure yet, but probably just more advice on proper project management techniques.
