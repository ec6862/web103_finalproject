## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Talking to my TF about issues communicating with my teammate, as I haven't been able to reach out to them. Asides from that, the planning portion and noticing how the lab can help me out in my preparation.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Communicating and delegating tasks to each other, as I was unable to reach out to my groupmates about potential solutions.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As of now, more leniency on deadlines as I have reached out to my groupmates and advisors, but haven't heard back from them yet.
